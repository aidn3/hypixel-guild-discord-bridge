# hypixel-guild-discord-bridge
Service connects multiple guilds and discord server together  
This project is made to be fully flexible and customizable
offering quality user experience while keeping it simple
> **Disclaimer: This project interacts with hypixel in an unintended way by simulating a minecraft client and process packets which might gets you banned if you over-abuse it much.  
> Just like any other modification and service that interacts with Hypixel servers, this goes without saying: "Use at your own risk"**

### How to execute commands

**Note: Only the one person who holds administrate permission can execute command!**  
From In-game: `/msg username /guild party`  
From Discord: `/override /guild party`


## Webhook
"Webhooks can send messages to a text channel without having to log in as a bot."  
It is used if the targeted community isn't within the admins' jurisdiction.  
Used to avoid giving any account login information (e.g. password, tokens, etc) or running the cluster in one server.

### Receive Messages
To receive messages, you need to 
- Create a **Discord webhook** in the used **guild public chat channel**
- Register the **webhook id** in `.env` (messages will be filtered otherwise)
- Give the FULL **webhook id** to the targeted community to send messages through

### Send Messages
- Receive the **full webhook url**
- Register it in `.env` (messages won't be sent over otherwise)

### Webhook Best Practice
It is best to exchange both send and receive keys and set up a two-way road for both community.  
`.env` Supports name for each community. You can for example exchange both keys and name the connection "Simple".
`WEBHOOK_simple="receive-id-here,send-url-here"`

## Metrics
hypixel-guild-discord-bridge supports [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) metrics, and it is **enabled by default** on port `9095`. 
Many metrics are automatically collected in memory and await prometheus to scrap them.

### Available Metrics
These are the currently monitored metrics. No usernames or anything personal is monitored. All metrics have the default prefix `guild_bridge_`. It can be changed in `./config/metrics-config.json`.

| Metric                        | Description                  | Source                                                  | metadata                                                                                                                                 |

| `PREFIX_command`              | Commands usage count         | Discord commands interactions and in-game chat commands | Same as chat metrics + `command`: command name                                                                                           |

### Metrics Config
All metrics config are in `./config/metrics-config.json`.  

In-game interval commands execution for metrics is **disabled by default**. 
Automatically sending commands non-stop to Hypixel might get the client banned for "botting".
Although the chance is next to non-existent, it is disabled for safe measures.

### Metrics With Grafana
Metrics can directly be used from Prometheus server by querying directly. 
However, to visualise the data, another server is required to do the job.
[Grafana](https://grafana.com) is one of the most popular and easy to use out there.
Many tutorials exist on the internet showcasing Grafana setups and settings.

Here are examples of **Prometheus query** and their results displayed using Grafana:

- Guild Chat:
```prometheus
sum(increase(guild_bridge_chat[1h])) by (scope,location)
```

- Guild Total Experience:
```prometheus
increase(guild_bridge_guild_exp_total[10m])
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aidn3/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge/media/metrics_guild_experience_total.png)

- Guild Current Online Members:
```
guild_bridge_guild_members_online
```
