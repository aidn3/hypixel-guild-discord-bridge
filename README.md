## Introduction

A service that connects multiple Hypixel guilds and Discord servers together.
This project is made to be fully flexible and customisable, offering a high quality user experience while keeping it simple.

> **_DISCLAIMER_: This project interacts with Hypixel in an unintended way by simulating a minecraft client and by processing
> packets which might get you banned if over-abused too much.  
> Just like any other modification and service that interacts with Hypixel servers, this goes without saying: "Use at
> your own risk"**

## Migrating To 3.x.x

Breaking changes:

- `config.yaml` has been reformatted. Check the new `config_example.yaml` and compare it with the old config file.
- Version 3.x websocket is incompatible with older versions. You cannot connect the new version with the old one.
- Chat Commands have been moved to their own instance in `config.yaml`. Only enable one instance when using websocket.
- Project has been moved to ESM. Old plugins that still use commonjs will not work anymore.
- The Minecraft bot and websocket have been stripped down to bare metal. Any plugins that use those features must be updated accordingly.
- The punishment system has been revised and now uses `./configs/` to save its state as a file. The `./configs/` directory is now git-ignored.
- Any unexpected errors during the launching phase will result in a shutdown with an exit code instead of sending a notification.

### How to use override

**Note: Only the one person who has administrator permissions can execute commands!**  
From In-game: `/gc !override /guild party`  
From Discord: `/override /guild party`

## Metrics

hypixel-guild-discord-bridge supports [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) metrics, and it is
**enabled by default** on port `9095`.
Many metrics are automatically collected in memory and await prometheus to scrap them.

### Available Metrics

These are the currently monitored metrics. No usernames or anything personal is monitored. All metrics have the default
prefix `guild_bridge_`. It can be changed in `config.yaml` under `metrics`.

| Metric                        | Description                  | Source                                                  | metadata                                                                                                                                        |

### Metrics Config

In-game periodic command execution for metrics are **disabled by default**.
Automatically sending commands non-stop to Hypixel might get the client banned for blatant automation.
Although the chance is next to none, it is disabled for safe measures.

### Metrics With Grafana

Metrics can be directly used from the Prometheus server by querying it directly.
However, to visualise the data, another server is required to do the job.
[Grafana](https://grafana.com) is one of the most popular and easy to use out there.
Many tutorials exist on the internet showcasing Grafana setups and configs.

Here are examples of **Prometheus queries** and their results displayed using Grafana:

- Guild Chat:

```prometheus
sum(increase(guild_bridge_chat[1h])) by (scope,location)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aidn3/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge/media/metrics_guild_chat.png)

- Guild Total Experience:

```prometheus
increase(guild_bridge_guild_exp_total[10m])
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aidn3/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge/media/metrics_guild_experience_total.png)

- Guild Current Online Members:

```
guild_bridge_guild_members_online
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aidn3/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge/media/metrics_guild_members_online.png)

## Installing and Running

### Prerequisites

- [Nodejs version 1.18 or later](https://nodejs.dev/download)
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (usually installed by default with `Nodejs`)
- Minecraft alt account
- (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Download

Clone and download the complete project by using `Git` tool:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aidn3/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge
```

Alternatively, [download the source code](https://github.com/aidn3/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
directly without any revisions. (Updating the service will be difficult)

### Configure

- Explore the project files and copy the contents of `.config_example.yaml` into `config.yaml`
- Open `config.yaml` and fill in the information (Security: `config.yaml` contains sensitive information. Keep it safe!)
- In `config.yaml` fill out `general.hypixelApiKey` and `discord` and `minecraft.instances`
- (Optional) for **Advanced users only:** Edit other options in `config.yaml` to fine tune the bridge

### Install

Install dependencies and libraries by executing the command:

```shell
npm install
```

New dictionary `node_modules` will be generated containing all required files.

### Run

Start the service by executing command:

```shell
npm start
```

## Run Via Docker

Alternatively, Docker image is available to use at [GitHub Container Service](https://github.com/aidn3/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge/pkgs/container/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge).
Image is usually up to date.

To start, first prepare the configuration as instructed in [this section](#configure). Then execute:

```shell
sudo docker container run -it --rm -v ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml ghcr.io/aidn3/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge:latest
```

Note that the path of the configuration source file must either be relative (with the `./`) or absolute.

Alternatively, providing the path as an argument to the docker container is also possible:

```shell
sudo docker container run -it --rm -v ./config.yaml:/config/config.yaml ghcr.io/aidn3/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge:latest /config/config.yaml
```

---

## Advanced

This section is for advanced users who wish to run a bridge that supports thousands of online players with dozens of
connected guilds.

### Sockets And Cluster Nodes

Bridge supports cluster mode. That means, the bridge can be divided into smaller parts and be hosted on different servers
and all be connected via sockets.  
When to use cluster mode:

- If more than 2 Minecraft accounts are connected from same host server. Hypixel will IP ban all accounts for "
  compromised account" or "suspicious activity"
- If a Minecraft account owner wishes to hold the login details by hosting a part of the bridge on their server

### Node Modes

Each node supports two modes: `client` and `server`.
Only one server can exist and all clients will connect to it (Server must also not be behind a firewall).

- Server mode is just an extension of client mode. It supports instances as well as Discord bridge and minecraft bots
- Server's goal is to only forward all events and data and distribute it to all clients
- Server will not wait for client to reconnect when forwarding events. Clients however will wait to re-sync with server

### Setup Cluster

All configurations will be in `config.yaml` under `socket` section.

- Follow the [Setup](#installing-and-running) process for each node, but don't start them yet
- Set config `enabled` to true.
- Choose a secure password and set it under `key`. (Security: Anyone can hijack the bridge if it is easily guessable)
- Choose which node shall act as the "Server" and set it under config `type`
- Set the config `uri` to the server node socket to connect to
- Start all nodes
